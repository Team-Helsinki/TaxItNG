                                    For many years Nigeria has suffered the indignity of being the only top six OPEC Nation without the capacity to refine 
                                    enough petroleum to satisfy its local consumption. As a result, the nation has endured perennial scarcity of petroleum 
                                    products for decades, but thankfully, that sad chapter of our national life is about to come to an end with the completion 
                                    of the ELEME REFINERY.
                            </p>
                                    Two years ago, the Federal Government of Nigeria initiated this laudable project to build from scratch, a world-class 
                                    refinery that will output more than enough petrol to satisfy local consumption and save the nation’s blushes. If you are 
                                    asking what makes this project different and more likely to succeed, first, this refinery is located in the heart of the oil 
                                    producing Niger Delta region which reduces the cost of supplying crude oil to the facility unlike the logistic nightmare that 
                                    is the Kaduna refinery.
                            </p>
                            <div class="none">
                            <p>
                                                    Also, this administration has signed a 20-year maintenance contract with Siemens, its installation partners, 
                                                    to handle the maintenance of the refinery for the duration of the contract. This move will ensure that the refinery doesn’t fall 
                                                    into a state of disrepair as the other refineries have done. During this period Siemens will train at least 100,000 Nigerians in 
                                                    all the key areas of maintaining the refinery so that Nigerians will take over from them at the expiration of the contract.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                                        Now at 50% completion, the Federal Government has taken delivery of all the key components for the refinery including the 
                                                        antic continuous catalytic regeneration reactor pictured below and is on schedule to complete the project in another two 
                                                        years.
                            </p>

                                <h3 class="sleekify">Benefits of this project</h3>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Employment: An immediate dividend of the Eleme refinery project has been the huge boost it has given to our employment numbers, employing over 100,000 Nigerians in high, medium and low wage categories since the start of the project two years ago. The project is also expected to hire another 100,000 people before completion and another 200,000 on completion to operate the refinery.</li>
                                        <li>Ending fuel scarcity: The Eleme refinery is expected to produce 120 million litres of Premium Motor Spirit(PMS) which is twice our daily consumption quota which is currently at 54 million litres. With this amount of PMS being produced daily, the perennial fuel scarcity that has dogged us will never rise again.</li> 
                                        <li>Plug economic leakage: As soon as the Eleme refinery comes on stream there will be no need to continue the highly wasteful subsidy regime that has frittered away most of our crude oil earnings over the years. This would leave the Federal Government with even more money to spend on other useful capital projects that will impact the lives of Nigerians positively.</li>
                                        <li>Boost foreign reserves: Aside from plugging leakages, the Eleme refinery is also optimized to produce various petrochemical by-products from crude oil needed for manufacturing. This will mean even more income for us from the same quantity of oil than we used to earn by just exporting unrefined crude oil.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                            The Nigerian Economist’s “The Genesis of Power Generation in Nigeria” report states that in 1886, generators in Lagos were 
                                            first used to provide 60 kilowatts electricity (Oct.1987). In the 21st century Nigeria, with a population of about 200 
                                            million people and an optimum energy need of over 40,000MW, we have the capacity to distribute just barely 5,000MW.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                                    Nigeria’s major energy generation sources are hydro and thermal stations which account for less than 14% of total energy 
                                                    source capacity. Gas takes a chunk of the energy pie with over 86%. The 2005 reforms allowed private industry players in 
                                                    through the signing of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act, which later birthed the three Nigerian energy sectors, 
                                                    namely the Electricity Generating Company, Transmission Company, and Distribution Company. Nigeria currently has 23 power 
                                                    generating plants connected to the national grid. The NIPP scheme plans to construct 8 additional new power plants, 5 
                                                    of which will be gas power plants.

                                                    Nigeria has the largest gas reserves in the whole of Africa and 9th in the world. Natural gas is the purest fossil fuel in 
                                                    the world which implies that natural gas is green and it's the future. Running Gas plants is the solution to Nigeria’s 
                                                    energy deficit if explored and followed through. It will solve the energy problem and also make our environment greener 
                                                    in this 21st century of climate change from consequences of the world’s industrial revolution.

                                                    That's just one example of an increasingly-popular technology used by millions around the world with many people unaware of 
                                                    what exactly is behind this– Artificial Intelligence (AI).Although to many, the thought of AI connotes a world where robots 
                                                    are in control to wreak havoc, the potential of AI largely transcends that. In simple terms, Artificial Intelligence is that 
                                                    field of Computer Science where computer systems are simulated to act as humans would. Use cases of AI vary from simple daily 
                                                    activities like the "Hey Siri!" command to complex scenarios of self-driven cars that obey traffic rules and anticipate

                                                On a grander scale, it is projected that by 2035, AI could double the economic growth rates in the developed economies where 
                                                continuous research efforts into this area are already being funded.

                                                "How can Nigeria tap into these possibilities?"  You might ask. A simple answer: By situating AI hubs in key regions and 
                                            universities across the country. 
                                           </p>

                                            Imagine a Nigeria where AI makes amazing drug discoveries and less-intrusive disease diagnosis models possible.
                                            What about stifling the nagging power outages plaguing the country by incorporating sophisticated AI-based algorithms into 
                                            solar grid panels and biogas plants? Think about how immensely useful an AI prediction tool with high accuracy would be to 
                                            the Nigerian Agricultural sector. That's not all, imagine the proliferation of a language automation system among African 
                                            nationals that reduces the communication barrier to Pan-African business.

                                                    The possibilities for a rapidly-developing economy triples with AI. Already, certain African countries like Ghana and Rwanda 
                                                    have picked up on this initiative and Nigeria cannot afford to be left behind. As citizens, we have to propel towards a common,

                                                The overall goal of the project is to adequately fund university education in Nigeria and make it free for all citizens 
                                                willing to acquire higher education.

                                                In many parts of the world, higher education is the instrument par excellence for development. There is a need to make 
                                                it free, relevant and responsive to the Nigerian society. This would require reliable and sufficient funding.

                                                A study produced for the World Bank in 2000 on the Nigerian education sector concluded that: “The public perception is 
                                                that the quality of education offered is low and that standards have dropped. These perceptions are based on lack of 
                                                adherence to acceptable educational practice. Teacher qualifications are low. The learning environment does not promote 
                                                effective learning. Basic facilities, teaching and learning resources are generally not available. Teacher-student 
                                                ratios are high. General performance in examinations is poor and the graduates have low levels of competencies in the work 
                                                environment.” Sources and systems of funding for Nigerian Universities have proven inadequate and lacking in innovation.

                                                <p>

                                               
                                                Food self-sufficiency is a matter of National security as it is dangerous for any nation to be dependent on others to 
                                                feed its own population. This is why the Buhari led Federal Government has set up FARMit with a clear mandate to ensure 
                                                that Nigeria is self-sufficient in food production by the end of his second term. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                FARMit is a technology driven project under the Ministry of Agriculture that aims to use its state-of-the-art AI research 
                                                capabilities to significantly boost food production and availability. 
                                            </p>

                                            <div class="none">

                                                With their data driven techniques, FARMit will pass the knowledge gleaned from their research on to farmers educating them 
                                                about threats, opportunities and better farm practices for greater yield.Also, given that most of our agricultural produce 
                                                is lost before it gets to the market due t poor storage facilities, FARMit will also build and manage strategically located,
                                                rld-class storage facilities around the country, including silos and cold rooms to ensure that we reduce food loss to the 
                                                barest minimum.

                                                <h4>Benefits of the project</h4>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                Food security: The FARMit project will go a long way in increasing the quantity and availability of the most widely 
                                                consumed staple foods in Nigeria and make us less dependent on foreign governments for our sustenance. Eventually, 
                                                we shall become food secure.
                                                Poverty reduction: It is estimated that most Nigerians spend over 50% of household income on food primarily because of high
                                                food prices caused by importation. The increased food production and better preservation facilities that would be brought 
                                                on stream with FARMit will significantly improve food availability and drive the price of food downwards thereby making the 
                                                verage Nigerian richer as they spend less on food 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Employment: FARMit is expected to directly employ 100,000 Nigerians within its first two years of operation and indirectly 
                                                employ another 200,000 farmers. This will go a long way in addressing the rising unemployment among our teeming youth 
                                                population.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Export: With increased efficiency in food production and storage as a result of the activities of FARMit, soon we will 
                                                become net exporters of key food items to our neighbours and the rest of the world. The foreign exchange earned from 
                                                exporting food will then be committed to other pressing infrastructural projects to make life better for Nigerians.
