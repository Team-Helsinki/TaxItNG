              For many years Nigeria has suffered the indignity of being the
              only top six OPEC Nation without the capacity to refine enough
              petroleum to satisfy its local consumption. As a result, the
              nation has endured perennial scarcity of petroleum products for
              decades, but thankfully, that sad chapter of our national life is
              about to come to an end with the completion of the ELEME REFINERY.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              Two years ago, the Federal Government of Nigeria initiated this
              laudable project to build from scratch, a world-class refinery
              that will output more than enough petrol to satisfy local
              consumption and save the nation’s blushes.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are asking what makes this project different and more
              likely to succeed, first, this refinery is located in the heart of
              the oil producing Niger Delta region which reduces the cost of
              supplying crude oil to the facility unlike the logistic nightmare
              that is the Kaduna refinery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, this administration has signed a 20-year maintenance
              contract with Siemens, its installation partners, to handle the
              maintenance of the refinery for the duration of the contract. This
              move will ensure that the<img
                src="../img/Oil_Refinery_Photo.jpg"
                align="right"
                height="250"
              />
              refinery doesn’t fall into a state of disrepair as the other
              refineries have done. During this period Siemens will train at
              least 100,000 Nigerians in all the key areas of maintaining the
              refinery so that Nigerians will take over from them at the
              expiration of the contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now at 50% completion, the Federal Government has taken delivery
              of all the key components for the refinery including the gigantic
              continuous catalytic regeneration reactor pictured below and is on
              schedule to complete the project in another two years.
            </p>

            <p>Benefits of this project</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Employment: An immediate dividend of the Eleme refinery project
                has been the huge boost it has given to our employment numbers,
                employing over 100,000 Nigerians in high, medium and low wage
                categories since the start of the project two years ago. The
                project is also expected to hire another 100,000 people before
                completion and another 200,000 on completion to operate the
                refinery.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ending fuel scarcity: The Eleme refinery is expected to produce
                120 million litres of Premium Motor Spirit(PMS) which is twice
                our daily consumption quota which is currently at 54 million
                litres. With this amount of PMS being produced daily, the
                perennial fuel scarcity that has dogged us will never rise
                again.
              </li>
              <li>
                Plug economic leakage: As soon as the Eleme refinery comes on
                stream there will be no need to continue the highly wasteful
                subsidy regime that has frittered away most of our crude oil
                earnings over the years. This would leave the Federal Government
                with even more money to spend on other useful capital projects
                that will impact the lives of Nigerians positively.
              </li>
              <li>
                Boost foreign reserves: Aside from plugging leakages, the Eleme
                refinery is also optimized to produce various petrochemical
                by-products from crude oil needed for manufacturing. This will
                mean even more income for us from the same quantity of oil than
                we used to earn by just exporting unrefined crude oil.
              </li>
            </ol>
